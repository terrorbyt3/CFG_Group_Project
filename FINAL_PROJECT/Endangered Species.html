            <p>The snow leopard is a large cat native to the mountain ranges of central and South Asia. At last count its population is estimated to be between 4,000 to 10,000 mature individuals in the wild. It is threatened by poaching and habitat destruction due 
                    to deterioration from climate change. Snow leopards live at high altitudes, usually at elevations of 3,000 to 4,500m. They prefer steep, broken terrain like cliffs, rocky outcrops and ravines. Having short forelimbs and long hind legs helps keep them agile 
                    in their steep and rugged environment. Their fur keeps them well insulated in cold weather - it can be 5cm long on their back and sides and almost 12cm long on their belly. Snow leopards' tails are up to 1 metre long, they aid the animals balance and they 
                    also wrap the tail around themselves for added warmth. Despite being called the snow 'leopard', this big cat is more closely related to the tiger than the leopard.  Unlike other big cats such as the tiger, snow leopards can't roar. Snow leopards have a 
                    call described as a 'piercing yowl' that's so loud it can be heard over the roar of a river.</p>

            <p>The African wild dog also commonly called the painted dog, is a native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is the largest indigenous canine in Africa. The name refers to the animal's irregular mottled coat pattern, which features patches of red, black, brown, white,
                    and yellow fur. Each animal has its own unique coat pattern, and all have big rounded ears. It is a highly social animal living in packs, dominated by a monogamous brewing pair, with separate hierarchies for sub males and females. Social interactions amongst 
                    pack members are common and the dogs communicate by touch, actions, and vocalisations. They’ll even look after injured dogs, bringing them food until they recover. African wild dogs hunt in formidable, cooperative packs of six to 20 animals. 
                    Larger packs were more common before the dogs became endangered. Packs hunt antelopes predominantly and chase the prey animal to the point of exhaustion.</p>

            <img class="images" src="./Images/Sumatran tiger.png" alt="Sumatran Tiger">
            <p>The Sumatran tiger is a subspecies of tiger native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It’s the smallest of the tigers, thought to be because it evolved on an isolated island habitat. The Sumatran tiger’s stripes are closer together and its fur is a darker orange 
                than other tigers, better allowing it to blend into its tropical rainforest habitat. Like all tigers, Sumatran tigers are carnivores. As ambush predators they will prey on almost any available animal, big or small. This includes fish, monkeys, wild boar, tapirs,
                and deer, among many others. They hunt at night and tend to make about one large kill a week. Habitat loss and poaching are the two biggest threats the critically endangered Sumatran tiger faces. The expansion of palm oil plantations is thought to be  the primary 
                driver behind the main loss in Sumatran tiger habitat. Loss of prey animals because of deforestation is also having a negative effect on Sumatran tigers.</p>
